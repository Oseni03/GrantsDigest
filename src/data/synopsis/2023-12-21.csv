grantsgovsupport@nsf.gov",grantsgovsupport@nsf.gov,"Semiconductor microelectronic systems are at a crossroads. Continued advances in capabilities and reductions in costs across computing, sensing, and communications are threatened. Semiconductor technology has long advanced following the trends in miniaturization characterized by Moore&rsquo;s Law, underpinned by new materials, processes, devices, and architectures. However, the developments in these underpinning areas have often progressed independent of the application area, which has delayed their incorporation into next-generation technologies. Closing this gap is required to optimize future progress. Semiconductor materials, devices, and computing must be optimally co-designed, with simultaneous consideration of elements across the technology chain.


The benefits of co-design to advance semiconductor technology have been widely recognized in a variety of government and industry studies. A holistic, co-design approach can more rapidly create high-performance, robust, secure, compact, energy-efficient, and cost-effective solutions. The technological drivers include the need to reduce the energy consumption of computation and communication technologies; reduce the impact of device and system manufacturing on the environment; increase performance speed and capacity; and develop new computing systems.


The goal of this Future of Semiconductors (FuSe2) solicitation is to cultivate holistic, co-design approaches to fundamental research and workforce education and training in order to enable rapid progress in new semiconductor technologies. The future of semiconductor manufacturing will require the design and deployment of diverse new technologies in materials, chemical and materials processes, devices, and architectures through the development of application-driven systems. Partnerships between industry and academic institutions are essential to spurring this innovation, enabling technology transfer, informing research infrastructure needs, and training the future workforce.


The program seeks to fund research as well as education and workforce development to improve science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education at the nation&rsquo;s institutions of higher education, spanning two-year colleges and four-year universities including the minority-serving institutions with a goal to advance semiconductor design and manufacturing. NSF encourages bold, potentially transformative activities that address future semiconductor design and manufacturing challenges as well as shortages in the skilled scientists, engineers, and technician workforce. This solicitation encourages proposers to take a holistic perspective on workforce development, considering<span class=""cf0"">the participation of the full spectrum of diverse talent in STEM</span> career paths, advanced technologies, and research capabilities. All proposals must include education and workforce development plans integrated with the proposed research activities. This solicitation seeks proposals to perform fundamental research to enable a new paradigm in semiconductor capabilities through research grants focused on co-design approaches. Teams of all sizes, with a minimum of a PI and a co-PI, are encouraged.


Future of Semiconductor Co-Design Research and Education Grants (FuSe2) - Awards will be supported in FY 2024 up to $2M per award for up to a three-year grant period, commensurate with project scope and team size. This program seeks to fund collaborative team research that transcends the traditional boundaries of individual disciplines to achieve program goals.


The three research topic areas identified for support in FY 2024 under this solicitation are:


Topic 1. Collaborative Research in Domain-Specific Computing.


Topic 2. Advanced Function and High-Performance by Heterogenous Integration.


Topic 3. New Materials for Energy-Efficient, Enhanced-Performance and Sustainable Semiconductor-Based Systems.


Details are provided under Program Description in Section II. Each proposal should explicitly identify at least one of these research topic areas in the title to focus on, though proposals which merge ideas from multiple topic areas are encouraged. Every proposal should address co-design covering at least two of the areas in the technology stack (materials, devices, and systems) in the research approach.

The correctional workplace is no different. Although looking into the hiring practices of correctional institutions is a worthy cause, this cooperative agreement looks more generally at retaining staff by adding more civility into the correctional workplace.</p><p><br></p><p>Workplace incivility describes the subtle and obvious behaviors that are generally rude, discourteous, and suggesting of a lack of respect for others. When unchecked, incivility erodes an organization’s culture and adversely affects the well-being of those who are the targets of uncivil behavior.</p><p><br></p><p>Workplace incivility needs to be challenged and talked about openly. Knowing the causes of incivility, its consequences, and how to promote civility in the workplace can help correctional leaders and employees build psychologically safe environments where everyone grows and thrives.</p><p><br></p><p>In the correctional environment, incivility in the workplace has a far greater consequence than just losing good staff. In the two-part webinar series for this project, NIC Correctional Program Specialist Christopher Smith said, “I think that civility is not just the mere absence of incivility or conflict, but instead it is the intentional effort made toward creating a correctional workplace that is built on the idea that by purposefully lifting each other up, we strive for safer correctional facilities for staff, justice-involved individuals, and the general public. Likewise, incivility is not merely the lack of civility, but it is the workplace that is run with unintentionality or lack of concern toward staff wellness. It is the idea that if you’re not lifting people up then by definition you are either pushing them down or allowing them to fall and fail.”</p><p>Incivility in the correctional workplace can lead to staff abuse of sick leave, alcohol/drug abuse, increase in medical challenges, an increase in mental health concerns, shortened life spans after retiring or leaving the correctional workplace, and an increase in suicide rates. Not to mention the tertiary effect on incarcerated men and women and their rehabilitation rates when they are housed at a facility that has a high level of incivility.</p><p><br></p><p>So, what does incivility in a correctional workplace look like? It looks like sexual harassment, the presence of racial bias, the presence of a toxic work environment, bullying of subordinate staff by supervisory staff, or the bullying of coworkers by non-supervisory staff. It can also be normalized or displayed as other forms of disrespect among staff in a meeting or as they pass in a hallway, or it can be rude comments about staff weight or appearance, inappropriate posters on the office wall, or a warden or superintendent that tacitly approves uncivil behavior by allowing it to continue. There are a number of activities that can be used to break fellow staff down.</p><p><br></p><p>Leaders and managers play an important role in cultivating civility in the workplace. There are certain leadership and management styles that promote civility and create an organizational culture where employees feel valued and respected. If leaders and managers use effective approaches that raise awareness about the existence and consequences of workplace incivility, they will be better positioned to create a civil climate that fosters a healthy organization.</p>","Feb 13, 2024 12:00:00 AM EST","Dec 15, 2023 12:00:00 AM EST","Mar 14, 2024 12:00:00 AM EDT",False,200000,"200,000",0,0,"NIC invites applications from nonprofit organizations (including faith-based, community, and tribal organizations), for-profit organizations (including tribal for-profit organizations), and institutions of higher education (including tribal institutions of higher education).

grantsgovsupport@nsf.gov",grantsgovsupport@nsf.gov,"In 1998 Congress enacted the American Competitiveness in the Twenty-First Century Act which provided funds to the National Science Foundation (NSF) to create a mechanism whereby the hiring of foreign workers in technology-intensive sectors on H-1B visas would help address the long-term workforce needs of the United States. Initially, scholarships were only provided for students in mathematics, engineering, and computer science. Later legislation authorized NSF to expand the eligible disciplines at the discretion of the NSF director. Undergraduate and graduate degrees in most disciplinary fields in which NSF provides research funding (with some exclusions described elsewhere in this document) are eligible as long as there is a national or regional demand for professionals with those degrees to address the long-term workforce needs of the United States.


The main goal of the S-STEM program is to enable low-income students with academic ability, talent or potential to pursue successful careers in promising STEM fields. Ultimately, the S-STEM program seeks to increase the number of academically promising low-income students who graduate with a S-STEM eligible degree and contribute to the American innovation economy with their STEM knowledge. Recognizing that financial aid alone cannot increase retention and graduation in STEM, the program provides awards to institutions of higher education (IHEs) not only to fund scholarships, but also to adapt, implement, and study evidence-based curricular and co-curricular [1] activities that have been shown to be effective supporting recruitment, retention, transfer (if appropriate), student success, academic/career pathways, and graduation in STEM.


Social mobility for low-income students with academic potential is even more crucial than for students that enjoy other economic support structures. Hence, social mobility cannot be guaranteed unless the scholarship funds the pursuit of degrees in areas where rewarding jobs are available after graduation with an undergraduate or graduate degree.


The S-STEM program encourages collaborations, including but not limited to partnerships among different types of institutions; collaborations of S-STEM eligible faculty, researchers, and academic administrators focused on investigating the factors that affect low-income student success (e.g., institutional, educational, behavioral and social science researchers); and partnerships among institutions of higher education and business, industry, local community organizations, national labs, or other federal or state government organizations, as appropriate.


To be eligible, scholars must be domestic low-income students, with academic ability, talent or potential and with demonstrated unmet financial need who are enrolled in an associate, baccalaureate, or graduate degree program in an S-STEM eligible discipline. Proposers must provide an analysis that articulates the characteristics and academic needs of the population of students they are trying to serve. NSF is particularly interested in supporting the attainment of degrees in fields identified as critical needs for the Nation. Many of these fields have high demand for training professionals that can operate at the convergence of disciplines and include but are not limited to quantum computing and quantum science, robotics, artificial intelligence and machine learning, computer science and computer engineering, data science and computational science applied to other frontier STEM areas, and other STEM or technology fields in urgent need of domestic professionals. It is up to the proposer to make a compelling case that a field is a critical need field in the United States.


S-STEM Eligible Degree Programs


Associate of Arts, Associate of Science, Associate of Engineering, and Associate of Applied Science


Bachelor of Arts, Bachelor of Science, Bachelor of Engineering and Bachelor of Applied Science


Master of Arts, Master of Science and Master of Engineering


Doctoral (Ph.D. or other comparable doctoral degree)


S-STEM Eligible Disciplines


Disciplinary fields in which research is funded by NSF, including technology fields associated with the S-STEM-eligible disciplines (e.g., biotechnology, chemical technology, engineering technology, information technology, etc.).


The following degrees and disciplines are excluded:

<ul>
<li>Clinical degree programs, including medical degrees, nursing, veterinary medicine, pharmacy, physical therapy, and others not funded by NSF, are ineligible degrees.</li>
<li>Business school programs that lead to Bachelor of Arts or Science in Business Administration degrees (BABA/BSBA/BBA) are not eligible for S-STEM funding.</li>
<li>Masters and Doctoral degrees in Business Administration are also excluded.</li>
</ul>

Proposers are strongly encouraged to contact Program Officers before submitting a proposal if they have questions concerning degree or disciplinary eligibility.


The S-STEM program particularly encourages proposals from 2-year institutions, Minority Serving Institutions (MSIs), predominately undergraduate institutions, and urban, suburban and rural public institutions.

Effective infrastructure provides a strong foundation for socioeconomic vitality and broad improvement in quality of life. Robust, reliable and effective infrastructure spurs private-sector innovation, grows the economy, creates jobs, makes public-sector service provision more efficient, strengthens communities, promotes equal opportunity, protects the natural environment, enhances national security and fuels American leadership. Achieving these objectives requires the integration of expertise from across all science and engineering disciplines. SAI focuses on how fundamental knowledge about human reasoning and decision-making, governance, and social and cultural processes enables the building and maintenance of effective infrastructure that improves lives and society and builds on advances in technology and engineering. Successful projects will represent a convergence of expertise in one or more social, behavioral or economic sciences, deeply integrated with other disciplines to support substantial and potentially pathbreaking fundamental research applied to strengthening a specific focal infrastructure.

In this case ""omnibus"" means that this NRA has many individual program elements, each with its own due dates and topics. All together these cover the wide range of basic and applied supporting research and technology in space and Earth sciences supported by SMD. Awards will be made as grants, cooperative agreements, contracts, and inter- or intra-agency transfers, depending on the nature of the work proposed, the proposing organization, and/or program requirements. However, most extramural research awards deriving from ROSES will be grants, and many program elements of ROSES specifically exclude contracts, because contracts would not be appropriate for the nature of the work solicited. The typical period of performance for an award is three years, but some programs may allow up to five years and others specify shorter periods. In most cases, organizations of every type, Government and private, for profit and not-for-profit, domestic and foreign (with some caveats), may submit proposals without restriction on teaming arrangements.

Awards will be made for no more than $50,000 in federal funds per project. Proposals are sought that provide an opportunity for researchers (faculty, graduate students, post-doctoral), Sea Grant extension personnel, and industry members, or a mixture of participants, to enhance knowledge of aquaculture technologies, production practices and systems, and associated topics pertinent to the species or species group of interest to participants. The goal of this opportunity is that participants will utilize the knowledge and expertise gained through their travel experiences in their approach to improve aquaculture research, extension, or aquaculture production and/or business activities that will benefit the U.S. aquaculture industry.&nbsp;Available funding can be used to support travel costs, salary, and costs associated with outreach activities following travel. Travel must be focused on visiting aquaculture sites or facilities, either public or private. Funding for research activities is not permitted through this announcement. Successful applications will: identify, justify, and describe the need or needs to be addressed regarding improvement of aquaculture research, extension, or production activities, describe and document the proposed plan regarding how the proposed travel activities will address the identified need or needs, describe how the proposed activities will enhance aquaculture-related activities of project participants, and describe how the proposed activities will benefit the U.S. aquaculture industry and associated stakeholders. Applications require the standard 50% non-federal match for Sea Grant projects. Please note that it is envisioned that this funding opportunity, with potential variation in total funding available, will be reinstated annually, contingent on available funding. These investments are consistent with Sea Grant’s focus area of Sustainable Fisheries and Aquaculture (SFA) and the Sea Grant Network’s 10-year Aquaculture Vision, and support NOAA and Department of Commerce aquaculture goals.&nbsp;</span></p>

AnnMarie_Lauritsen@fws.gov",AnnMarie_Lauritsen@fws.gov,"Background, Purpose and Program Requirements:  The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service’s (Service) mission is to work with others to conserve, protect and enhance fish, wildlife, plants, and their habitats for the continuing benefit of the American people. The International Affairs Program delivers on this mission through its financial and technical assistance programs by supporting strategic projects that deliver measurable conservation results for priority species and their habitats around the world. Turtles represent one of the most imperiled animal groups on earth. Of the world’s 342 species of tortoises and freshwater turtles, more than half face the threat of extinction. Habitat loss and the legal and illegal trade of turtles and turtle products (for food, pets, and traditional medicines, etc.) continue to drive sharp declines in turtle populations globally. Recognizing the ecological value and alarming declines of turtles worldwide, the U.S. Congress established a conservation fund for tortoises and freshwater turtles (through the John Dingell, Jr. Conservation, Management, and Recreation Act, 2019, Public Law 116-9*), signed into law on March 12, 2019. The Service’s Tortoise and Freshwater Turtle Conservation Fund is soliciting proposals that conserve threatened tortoise and freshwater turtle species that occur in foreign countries and in territories of the United States.  Proposed work must occur outside of the 50 U.S. states or must demonstrate substantive conservation benefits to populations outside of the 50 U.S. states. The primary purpose of this new conservation fund is to provide financial support for projects that conserve populations and habitats of freshwater turtles and tortoises and address threats to their survival. The United States, second only to Asia in diversity of turtle species, has acted in recent decades as a steward of chelonian conservation, and this fund allows the Service to expand efforts to protect imperiled turtle species around the world.   Proposed work must occur outside of the 50 U.S. states or must demonstrate substantive conservation benefits to populations outside of the 50 U.S. states. The primary purpose of this new conservation fund is to provide financial support for projects that conserve populations and habitats of freshwater turtles and tortoises and address threats to their survival. The United States, second only to Asia in diversity of turtle species, has acted in recent decades as a steward of chelonian conservation, and this fund allows the Service to expand efforts to protect imperiled turtle species around the world.  The goal of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service’s (Service) Tortoise and Freshwater Turtle (TFT) Conservation Program is to recover and maintain viable populations of tortoise and freshwater turtles in the wild by addressing the critical threats to their survival. We do this through financial and technical assistance to support evidence-based interventions and regular evaluations that inform our tortoise and freshwater turtle conservation strategy and carry out the purpose of the Marine Turtle Conservation Act (MTCA).  Our strategy encompasses the following key objectives: Species Protection: Conserving TFTs in their habitats through focused, measurable actions that involve collaborating with essential stakeholders to reduce threats such as exploitation, harmful fishing practices and predation.Habitat Protection: Minimizing habitat loss, encroachment, and degradation by working closely with communities and land stewards to implement effective habitat protection and restoration techniques, with a special focus on nesting and foraging habitats in or around conservation areas. Combating Exploitation: Supporting community-led initiatives to reduce poaching through the development of alternative livelihoods, co-designed with local stakeholders, and behavior change campaigns grounded in social science concepts.    Legal Protections and Law Enforcement: Collaborating with government and regional authorities to enhance legal protections for TFTs by building intelligence information exchanges and bolstering law enforcement capacity. Demand Reduction: Facilitating behavior change outreach programs, informed by social science concepts, to curtail the demand for TFTs.   Competitive projects will work to support the Service's key objectives and bolster long-term conservation capacity for TFTs. We broadly define capacity to include: 1) the capacity of habitat to sustain TFT populations through threat reduction and habitat restoration activities and 2) the capacity of individuals and institutions at local and national levels to champion the conservation of TFTs in those countries and regions. We prioritize the following actions to bolster long-term TFT conservation capacity within the broader Service program goal:Cultivate enduring conservation capacity among local and indigenous communities, local and national non-governmental organizations, government bodies, and other pertinent stakeholders.Support the growth of local conservation initiatives that promotes opportunities to build skills and develop networks of local multidisciplinary practitioners relevant to TFT conservation. Facilitate information sharing between communities, turtle networks, government and regional authorities; and institutions on effective techniques to reduce the threats to TFTs in their habitats.  Identify and address gaps in TFT conservation through a comprehensive, interdisciplinary approach.Develop and implement community-led action plans with direct conservation impacts that promote sustained threat reduction and consistent monitoring (habitat or species) to identify and alert relevant entities for more urgent or expanded attention if increased threats are identified. Provide clear evidence of how the proposed activities will yield lasting, significant benefits for the species in focus. Proposals should demonstrate how project activities directly address one or more of the key objectives and actions and include a plan for monitoring and evaluation (i.e., measuring indicators). For this Notice of Funding Opportunity, while all projects that work to implement one or more of the overall Service program goals are eligible for funding, TFTs as listed in the table below or threat reduction activities focused in the geographic area of South Asia and Southeast Asia will be prioritized. Table 1: Taxonomic list by family of non-U.S. terrestrial tortoises and freshwater turtles with high extinction risk and most urgent conservation needs.FamilyTaxonCommon NameChelidaeChelodina mccordi mccordi and Chelodina mccordi timorensisRoti Island Snake-necked Turtle and Timor Snake-necked Turtle   GeoemydidaeBatagur affinis, Batagur baska, Batagur borneoensis, Batagur dhongoka, Batagur kachuga and Batagur trivittataSouthern River Terrapin, Northern River Terrapin, Painted Terrapin, Three-striped Roofed Turtle, Red-crowned Roof Turtle and Myanmar Roofed Turtle Cuora amboinensis, Cuora bourreti, Cuora cyclornata, Cuora galbinifrons, Cuora mouhotii and Cuora picturataSoutheast Asian Box Turtle, Bourret's Box Turtle, Vietnamese Three-striped Box Turtle, Indochinese Box Turtle, Keeled Box Turtle and Southern Vietnam Box Turtle Cyclemys atripons, Cyclemys oldhamii, Cyclemys pulchristriataWestern Black-bridged Leaf Turtle, Southeast Asian Leaf Turtle and Eastern Black-bridged Leaf Turtle Geoclemys hamiltoniiSpotted Pond Turtle Geoemyda spengleriBlack-breasted Leaf Turtle Hardella thurjiiCrowned River Turtle Heosemys annandalii, Heosemys depressa, Heosemys grandis and Heosemys spinosaYellow-headed Temple Turtle, Arakan Forest Turtle, Giant Asian Pond Turtle and Spiny Turtle Leucocephalon yuwonoiSulawesi Forest Turtle Mauremys annamensis and Mauremys muticaVietnamese Pond Turtle and Yellow Pond Turtle Melanochelys tricarinataTricarinate Hill Turtle Morenia ocellata and Morenia petersiBurmese Eyed Turtle and Indian Eyed Turtle Orlitia borneensisMalaysian Giant Turtle Pangshura sylhetensisAssam Roofed Turtle Sacalia bealei and Sacalia quadriocellataBeale’s Eyed Turtle and Four-eyed Turtle Siebenrockiella crassicollis and Siebenrockiella leytensisBlack Marsh Turtle and Palawan Forest Turtle Vijayachelys silvaticaCochin Forest Cane Turtle   PlatysternidaePlatysternon megacephalumBig-headed Turtle   TestudinidaeGeochelone platynotaBurmese Star Tortoise Indotestudo elongata, Indotestudo forstenii and Indotestudo travancoricaElongated Tortoise, Sulawesi Tortoise and Travancore Tortoise Manouria emys and Manouria impressaAsian Giant Tortoise and Impressed Tortoise   TrionychidaeChitra chitra, Chitra indica and Chitra vandijkiSoutheast Asian Narrow-headed Softshell Turtle, South Asian Narrow-headed Softshell Turtle and Myanmar Narrow-headed Softshell Turtle Nilssonia formosa, Nilssonia gangetica, Nilssonia hurum, Nilssonia leithii and Nilssonia nigricansMyanmar Peacock Softshell Turtle, Indian Softshell Turtle, and Indian Peacock Softshell Turtle, Leith’s Softshell Turtle and Black Softshell Turtle Palea steindachneri, Pelochelys cantorii and Rafetus swinhoeiWattle-necked Softshell Turtle, Asian Giant Softshell Turtle and Yangtze Giant Softshell Turtle ","Feb 19, 2024 12:00:00 AM EST","Dec 14, 2023 12:00:00 AM EST","Nov 06, 2025 12:00:00 AM EST",False,450000,"450,000",150000,"150,000","Applicants may be individuals, multinational secretariats, foreign national and local government agencies, U.S. and foreign non-profits, non-governmental organizations, for-profit organizations, community and Indigenous organizations, U.S. and foreign public and private institutions of higher education, and U.S. territorial governments.&nbsp; &nbsp;","Dec 14, 2023 02:17:09 PM EST","Dec 14, 2023 02:17:09 PM EST"
