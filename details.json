        "synopsisDesc": "Semiconductor microelectronic systems are at a crossroads. Continued advances in capabilities and reductions in costs across computing, sensing, and communications are threatened. Semiconductor technology has long advanced following the trends in miniaturization characterized by Moore&rsquo;s Law, underpinned by new materials, processes, devices, and architectures. However, the developments in these underpinning areas have often progressed independent of the application area, which has delayed their incorporation into next-generation technologies. Closing this gap is required to optimize future progress. Semiconductor materials, devices, and computing must be optimally co-designed, with simultaneous consideration of elements across the technology chain.\n\r\n\nThe benefits of co-design to advance semiconductor technology have been widely recognized in a variety of government and industry studies. A holistic, co-design approach can more rapidly create high-performance, robust, secure, compact, energy-efficient, and cost-effective solutions. The technological drivers include the need to reduce the energy consumption of computation and communication technologies; reduce the impact of device and system manufacturing on the environment; increase performance speed and capacity; and develop new computing systems.\n\r\n\nThe goal of this Future of Semiconductors (FuSe2) solicitation is to cultivate holistic, co-design approaches to fundamental research and workforce education and training in order to enable rapid progress in new semiconductor technologies. The future of semiconductor manufacturing will require the design and deployment of diverse new technologies in materials, chemical and materials processes, devices, and architectures through the development of application-driven systems. Partnerships between industry and academic institutions are essential to spurring this innovation, enabling technology transfer, informing research infrastructure needs, and training the future workforce.\n\r\n\nThe program seeks to fund research as well as education and workforce development to improve science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education at the nation&rsquo;s institutions of higher education, spanning two-year colleges and four-year universities including the minority-serving institutions with a goal to advance semiconductor design and manufacturing. NSF encourages bold, potentially transformative activities that address future semiconductor design and manufacturing challenges as well as shortages in the skilled scientists, engineers, and technician workforce. This solicitation encourages proposers to take a holistic perspective on workforce development, considering<span class=\"cf0\">the participation of the full spectrum of diverse talent in STEM</span> career paths, advanced technologies, and research capabilities. All proposals must include education and workforce development plans integrated with the proposed research activities. This solicitation seeks proposals to perform fundamental research to enable a new paradigm in semiconductor capabilities through research grants focused on co-design approaches. Teams of all sizes, with a minimum of a PI and a co-PI, are encouraged.\n\r\n\nFuture of Semiconductor Co-Design Research and Education Grants (FuSe2) - Awards will be supported in FY 2024 up to $2M per award for up to a three-year grant period, commensurate with project scope and team size. This program seeks to fund collaborative team research that transcends the traditional boundaries of individual disciplines to achieve program goals.\n\r\n\nThe three research topic areas identified for support in FY 2024 under this solicitation are:\n\r\n\nTopic 1. Collaborative Research in Domain-Specific Computing.\n\r\n\nTopic 2. Advanced Function and High-Performance by Heterogenous Integration.\n\r\n\nTopic 3. New Materials for Energy-Efficient, Enhanced-Performance and Sustainable Semiconductor-Based Systems.\n\r\n\nDetails are provided under Program Description in Section II. Each proposal should explicitly identify at least one of these research topic areas in the title to focus on, though proposals which merge ideas from multiple topic areas are encouraged. Every proposal should address co-design covering at least two of the areas in the technology stack (materials, devices, and systems) in the research approach.\n\r\n\nPlease note that the program contact information is current at the time of publishing. See program website for any updates to the points of contact.",

Partnerships must substantially involve institutions seeking to create opportunities for student and faculty research that will increase the recruitment, retention, and success of these individuals. It is expected that the partnerships will build or strengthen research capacity, as well as foster a diverse, inclusive, and equitable environment for astronomy and astrophysics research and education at the partnering institutions.",

Two components differentiate LTER research from projects supported by other NSF programs: 1) the research is located at specific sites chosen to represent major ecosystem types or natural biomes, and 2) it emphasizes the study of ecological phenomena over long periods of time based on data collected in five core areas.

In the two-part webinar series for this project, NIC Correctional Program Specialist Christopher Smith said, \u201cI think that civility is not just the mere absence of incivility or conflict, but instead it is the intentional effort made toward creating a correctional workplace that is built on the idea that by purposefully lifting each other up, we strive for safer correctional facilities for staff, justice-involved individuals, and the general public. Likewise, incivility is not merely the lack of civility, but it is the workplace that is run with unintentionality or lack of concern toward staff wellness. It is the idea that if you\u2019re not lifting people up then by definition you are either pushing them down or allowing them to fall and fail.\u201d</p><p>Incivility in the correctional workplace can lead to staff abuse of sick leave, alcohol/drug abuse, increase in medical challenges, an increase in mental health concerns, shortened life spans after retiring or leaving the correctional workplace, and an increase in suicide rates.

It looks like sexual harassment, the presence of racial bias, the presence of a toxic work environment, bullying of subordinate staff by supervisory staff, or the bullying of coworkers by non-supervisory staff.

There are a number of activities that can be used to break fellow staff down.</p><p><br></p><p>Leaders and managers play an important role in cultivating civility in the workplace. There are certain leadership and management styles that promote civility and create an organizational culture where employees feel valued and respected.

        "synopsisDesc": "<p>The National Institute of Corrections (NIC) is the only federal agency with a legislative mandate (Public Law 93-415) to provide specialized services to corrections from a national perspective. NIC provides direct service as the primary means of carrying out its mission and responds directly to needs identified by practitioners working in state and local adult corrections, the Federal Bureau of Prisons, the Department of Justice, other federal agencies, and the United States Congress. As a center of learning innovation that shapes and advances effective correctional practice and public policy</p><p>One of the barriers to advancement for women has been their perception of their abilities as leaders.</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cBecause of the female social conditioning, women may need more support and encouragement to achieve leadership.\u201d (Harriman, 1986, p.168) Women in middle management, often operating in gender isolation, need to be trained sooner and in greater numbers. This program accepts a minimum of eight participants from each state, immediately providing a new support network within the states. By adjoining states cooperating together, the net of support, relationship and a stronger workforce pool is widened. To date, over twenty-five Directors/Commissioners have recognized the value and impact of this training by their applications for participation.</p><p><br></p><p>As the number of women entering the workforce increases, organizations in the private and public sectors recognize the need to develop training specifically designed to enhance their capabilities to achieve middle and upper management level positions. Thus, this program supplies the leadership theories, and the leadership assessment tools, followed by numerous learning tasks and activities, structured to use enhance supervisory and leadership abilities. NIC, recognizing that these are our constituents, has taken the much -needed steps to fill the training gap needed to support women having to operate under conventional male-oriented standards.</p>",

Mykiss). Water resources development, stream channel manipulations, and other anthropogenic actions have reduced and modified historical salmonid habitats. Gravel is regularly transported from spawning sites on the river and there is less utilizable rearing habitat. Infrastructure entrains juveniles, impairs passage, and increases susceptibility to predation.Relevant purposes of the Central Valley Project Improvement Act (CVPIA) include:To protect, restore, and enhance fish, wildlife, and associated habitats in the Central Valley and Trinity River basins of California;To address impacts of the Central Valley Project (CVP) on fish, wildlife and associated habitats;To improve the operational flexibility of the CVP;To achieve a reasonable balance among competing demands for use of CVP water, including the requirements of fish and wildlife, agricultural, municipal and industrial and power contractors.",

Applications submitted to this NOFO must include studies that meet the National Institutes of Health (NIH) definition of a clinical trial (see NOT-OD-15-015 for details) and provide specific clinical trial information as described in this FOA. This NOFO does not and will not support clinical trials for studies of cancer diagnosis and/or oncologic therapy in patients. The proposed investigator-initiated projects should be related to the programmatic interests of the NCI Division of Cancer Prevention and/or the NCI Division of Cancer Control and Population Sciences.",

Institution of Higher Education\r\n\r\nU.S. academic institutions are eligible to submit applications under this FOA. An employee with a joint appointment between a university and a DOE national laboratory must apply through the institution that pays his or her salary and provides his or her benefits.\r\n\r\nIII.A.2. DOE/NNSA National Laboratories\r\n\r\nDOE/NNSA National Laboratories are eligible to submit applications under this FOA. If recommended for funding as a lead applicant, funding will be provided through the DOE Field-Work Proposal System. If recommended for funding as a proposed subawardee, the value of the proposed subaward will be removed from the prime applicant&rsquo;s award and will be provided to the laboratory through the DOE Field-Work Proposal System. Additional instructions for securing authorization from the cognizant Contracting Officer are found in Section VIII of this FOA. \r\n\r\nSubmission of a pre-application (in PAMS) or an application (in Grants.gov) by an authorized institutional representative is a confirmation that the proposed research idea fits within the scope of SC-funded programs at the national laboratory. Proposing research that falls within this category ensures that investigators have the opportunity to belong to or join, at the laboratory&rsquo;s discretion, funded research groups. \r\n\r\nInvestigators funded under this program are encouraged to charge at least 50% of their time to the award, allowing time to develop or maintain funded collaborations within the lab over the course of the award. Amounts less than 50% should be as close to 50% as possible. Making sure that investigators have potential connections with SC funded programs encourages the laboratory to actively plan to address funding transition issues that may arise when an award ends. \r\n\r\nApplications from DOE National Laboratories should not (a) attempt to revive previously terminated research areas within the laboratory or (b) topically isolate investigators. \r\nEligibility exemptions will not be granted.\r\n\r\nIII.A.3. SC Scientific User Facilities not at a DOE/NNSA National Laboratory\r\n\r\nInstitutions operating SC Scientific User Facilities are eligible to submit applications under this FOA. If recommended for funding as a lead applicant, funding will be provided as a financial assistance award to the non-Governmental entity operating the User Facility.",

        "synopsisDesc": "In 1998 Congress enacted the American Competitiveness in the Twenty-First Century Act which provided funds to the National Science Foundation (NSF) to create a mechanism whereby the hiring of foreign workers in technology-intensive sectors on H-1B visas would help address the long-term workforce needs of the United States. Initially, scholarships were only provided for students in mathematics, engineering, and computer science. Later legislation authorized NSF to expand the eligible disciplines at the discretion of the NSF director. Undergraduate and graduate degrees in most disciplinary fields in which NSF provides research funding (with some exclusions described elsewhere in this document) are eligible as long as there is a national or regional demand for professionals with those degrees to address the long-term workforce needs of the United States.\n\r\n\nThe main goal of the S-STEM program is to enable low-income students with academic ability, talent or potential to pursue successful careers in promising STEM fields. Ultimately, the S-STEM program seeks to increase the number of academically promising low-income students who graduate with a S-STEM eligible degree and contribute to the American innovation economy with their STEM knowledge. Recognizing that financial aid alone cannot increase retention and graduation in STEM, the program provides awards to institutions of higher education (IHEs) not only to fund scholarships, but also to adapt, implement, and study evidence-based curricular and co-curricular [1] activities that have been shown to be effective supporting recruitment, retention, transfer (if appropriate), student success, academic/career pathways, and graduation in STEM.\n\r\n\nSocial mobility for low-income students with academic potential is even more crucial than for students that enjoy other economic support structures. Hence, social mobility cannot be guaranteed unless the scholarship funds the pursuit of degrees in areas where rewarding jobs are available after graduation with an undergraduate or graduate degree.\n\r\n\nThe S-STEM program encourages collaborations, including but not limited to partnerships among different types of institutions; collaborations of S-STEM eligible faculty, researchers, and academic administrators focused on investigating the factors that affect low-income student success (e.g., institutional, educational, behavioral and social science researchers); and partnerships among institutions of higher education and business, industry, local community organizations, national labs, or other federal or state government organizations, as appropriate.\n\r\n\nTo be eligible, scholars must be domestic low-income students, with academic ability, talent or potential and with demonstrated unmet financial need who are enrolled in an associate, baccalaureate, or graduate degree program in an S-STEM eligible discipline. Proposers must provide an analysis that articulates the characteristics and academic needs of the population of students they are trying to serve. NSF is particularly interested in supporting the attainment of degrees in fields identified as critical needs for the Nation. Many of these fields have high demand for training professionals that can operate at the convergence of disciplines and include but are not limited to quantum computing and quantum science, robotics, artificial intelligence and machine learning, computer science and computer engineering, data science and computational science applied to other frontier STEM areas, and other STEM or technology fields in urgent need of domestic professionals. It is up to the proposer to make a compelling case that a field is a critical need field in the United States.\n\r\n\nS-STEM Eligible Degree Programs\n\r\n\nAssociate of Arts, Associate of Science, Associate of Engineering, and Associate of Applied Science\n\r\n\nBachelor of Arts, Bachelor of Science, Bachelor of Engineering and Bachelor of Applied Science\n\r\n\nMaster of Arts, Master of Science and Master of Engineering\n\r\n\nDoctoral (Ph.D. or other comparable doctoral degree)\n\r\n\nS-STEM Eligible Disciplines\n\r\n\nDisciplinary fields in which research is funded by NSF, including technology fields associated with the S-STEM-eligible disciplines (e.g., biotechnology, chemical technology, engineering technology, information technology, etc.).\n\r\n\nThe following degrees and disciplines are excluded:\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Clinical degree programs, including medical degrees, nursing, veterinary medicine, pharmacy, physical therapy, and others not funded by NSF, are ineligible degrees.</li>\r\n<li>Business school programs that lead to Bachelor of Arts or Science in Business Administration degrees (BABA/BSBA/BBA) are not eligible for S-STEM funding.</li>\r\n<li>Masters and Doctoral degrees in Business Administration are also excluded.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\nProposers are strongly encouraged to contact Program Officers before submitting a proposal if they have questions concerning degree or disciplinary eligibility.\n\r\n\nThe S-STEM program particularly encourages proposals from 2-year institutions, Minority Serving Institutions (MSIs), predominately undergraduate institutions, and urban, suburban and rural public institutions.\n\r\n\n[1] an activity at a school or college pursued in addition to the normal course of study.",

Effective infrastructure provides a strong foundation for socioeconomic vitality and broad improvement in quality of life. Robust, reliable and effective infrastructure spurs private-sector innovation, grows the economy, creates jobs, makes public-sector service provision more efficient, strengthens communities, promotes equal opportunity, protects the natural environment, enhances national security and fuels American leadership. Achieving these objectives requires the integration of expertise from across all science and engineering disciplines. SAI focuses on how fundamental knowledge about human reasoning and decision-making, governance, and social and cultural processes enables the building and maintenance of effective infrastructure that improves lives and society and builds on advances in technology and engineering. Successful projects will represent a convergence of expertise in one or more social, behavioral or economic sciences, deeply integrated with other disciplines to support substantial and potentially pathbreaking fundamental research applied to strengthening a specific focal infrastructure.\n\r\n\n<span>General inquiries regarding this funding opportunity should be sent to<a href=\"mailto:NSF-SAI@nsf.gov\">NSF-SAI@nsf.gov</a>.</span>",

In this case \"omnibus\" means that this NRA has many individual program elements, each with its own due dates and topics. All together these cover the wide range of basic and applied supporting research and technology in space and Earth sciences supported by SMD. Awards will be made as grants, cooperative agreements, contracts, and inter- or intra-agency transfers, depending on the nature of the work proposed, the proposing organization, and/or program requirements. However, most extramural research awards deriving from ROSES will be grants, and many program elements of ROSES specifically exclude contracts, because contracts would not be appropriate for the nature of the work solicited. The typical period of performance for an award is three years, but some programs may allow up to five years and others specify shorter periods. In most cases, organizations of every type, Government and private, for profit and not-for-profit, domestic and foreign (with some caveats), may submit proposals without restriction on teaming arrangements.

Awards will be made for no more than $50,000 in federal funds per project. Proposals are sought that provide an opportunity for researchers (faculty, graduate students, post-doctoral), Sea Grant extension personnel, and industry members, or a mixture of participants, to enhance knowledge of aquaculture technologies, production practices and systems, and associated topics pertinent to the species or species group of interest to participants. The goal of this opportunity is that participants will utilize the knowledge and expertise gained through their travel experiences in their approach to improve aquaculture research, extension, or aquaculture production and/or business activities that will benefit the U.S. aquaculture industry.&nbsp;Available funding can be used to support travel costs, salary, and costs associated with outreach activities following travel. Travel must be focused on visiting aquaculture sites or facilities, either public or private. Funding for research activities is not permitted through this announcement. Successful applications will: identify, justify, and describe the need or needs to be addressed regarding improvement of aquaculture research, extension, or production activities, describe and document the proposed plan regarding how the proposed travel activities will address the identified need or needs, describe how the proposed activities will enhance aquaculture-related activities of project participants, and describe how the proposed activities will benefit the U.S. aquaculture industry and associated stakeholders. Applications require the standard 50% non-federal match for Sea Grant projects. Please note that it is envisioned that this funding opportunity, with potential variation in total funding available, will be reinstated annually, contingent on available funding. These investments are consistent with Sea Grant\u2019s focus area of Sustainable Fisheries and Aquaculture (SFA) and the Sea Grant Network\u2019s 10-year Aquaculture Vision, and support NOAA and Department of Commerce aquaculture goals.&nbsp;</span></p> \n<p><span style=\"background-color: transparent;\">This competition is open to all Sea Grant Programs.

As a component of the NCI's Informatics Technology for Cancer Research (ITCR) Program, the emphasis of this FOA is on supporting the development of novel informatics capabilities that involve a high degree of innovation that have the potential to accelerate or enhance research. To be successful, there must be a clear rationale for how the proposed informatics method or algorithm is novel and how it will benefit the cancer research field. Projects proposing the application of existing methods or algorithms where the novelty resides in the biological or clinical question being pursued are not responsive to this solicitation and will not be reviewed.",

        "synopsisDesc": "The purpose of this Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) is to invite Cooperative Agreement (U24) applications for advanced development and enhancement of emerging informatics technologies to improve the acquisition, management, analysis, and dissemination of data and knowledge across the cancer research continuum including cancer biology, cancer treatment and diagnosis, early cancer detection, risk assessment and prevention, cancer control and epidemiology, and/or cancer health disparities. As a component of the NCI's Informatics Technology for Cancer Research (ITCR) Program, this FOA focuses on emerging informatics technology, defined as one that has passed the initial prototyping and pilot development stage, has demonstrated potential to have a significant and broader impact, has compelling reasons for further improvement and enhancement, and has not been widely adopted in the cancer research field. The central mission of ITCR is to promote research-driven informatics technology across the development lifecycle to address priority needs in cancer research. In order to be successful, proposed development plans must have a clear rationale on why the proposed technology is needed and how it will benefit the cancer research field. In addition, mechanisms to solicit feedback from users and collaborators throughout the development process must be included. Potential applicants who are interested in early-stage development or informatics resource sustainment should consult the companion FOAs listed above.",

Proposed research projects must focus on recapitulation of the human immune system in their proposed cancer model using human cells or tissues to regenerate and/or recapitulate the human immune system in in vivo or in vitro immuno-oncology models in a manner that matches or exceeds representation of the human immune system achieved with murine models developed using HFT. Models derived from genetically manipulated immune systems without introduction of human immune lineage cells will not be considered responsive.The FOA will utilize the R33 Exploratory/Developmental Grants Phase II research activity code.",

        "synopsisDesc": "Background, Purpose and Program Requirements:\u00a0\u00a0The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service\u2019s (Service) mission is to work with others to conserve, protect and enhance fish, wildlife, plants, and their habitats for the continuing benefit of the American people. The International Affairs Program delivers on this mission through its financial and technical assistance programs by supporting strategic projects that deliver measurable conservation results for priority species and their habitats around the world.\u00a0Turtles represent one of the most imperiled animal groups on earth. Of the world\u2019s 342 species of tortoises and freshwater turtles, more than half face the threat of extinction. Habitat loss and the legal and illegal trade of turtles and turtle products (for food, pets, and traditional medicines, etc.) continue to drive sharp declines in turtle populations globally. Recognizing the ecological value and alarming declines of turtles worldwide, the U.S. Congress established a conservation fund for tortoises and freshwater turtles (through the John Dingell, Jr. Conservation, Management, and Recreation Act, 2019, Public Law 116-9*), signed into law on March 12, 2019. The Service\u2019s Tortoise and Freshwater Turtle Conservation Fund is soliciting proposals that conserve threatened tortoise and freshwater turtle species that occur in foreign countries and in territories of the United States.\u00a0\u00a0Proposed work must occur outside of the 50 U.S. states or must demonstrate substantive conservation benefits to populations outside of the 50 U.S. states. The primary purpose of this new conservation fund is to provide financial support for projects that conserve populations and habitats of freshwater turtles and tortoises and address threats to their survival. The United States, second only to Asia in diversity of turtle species, has acted in recent decades as a steward of chelonian conservation, and this fund allows the Service to expand efforts to protect imperiled turtle species around the world.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Proposed work must occur outside of the 50 U.S. states or must demonstrate substantive conservation benefits to populations outside of the 50 U.S. states. The primary purpose of this new conservation fund is to provide financial support for projects that conserve populations and habitats of freshwater turtles and tortoises and address threats to their survival. The United States, second only to Asia in diversity of turtle species, has acted in recent decades as a steward of chelonian conservation, and this fund allows the Service to expand efforts to protect imperiled turtle species around the world.\u00a0\u00a0The goal of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service\u2019s (Service) Tortoise and Freshwater Turtle (TFT) Conservation Program is to recover and maintain viable populations of tortoise and freshwater turtles in the wild by addressing the critical threats to their survival. We do this through financial and technical assistance to support evidence-based interventions and regular evaluations that inform our tortoise and freshwater turtle conservation strategy and carry out the purpose of the Marine Turtle Conservation Act (MTCA).\u00a0\u00a0Our strategy encompasses the following key objectives:\u00a0Species Protection: Conserving TFTs in their habitats through focused, measurable actions that involve collaborating with essential stakeholders to reduce threats such as exploitation, harmful fishing practices and predation.Habitat Protection: Minimizing habitat loss, encroachment, and degradation by working closely with communities and land stewards to implement effective habitat protection and restoration techniques, with a special focus on nesting and foraging habitats in or around conservation areas.\u00a0Combating Exploitation: Supporting community-led initiatives to reduce poaching through the development of alternative livelihoods, co-designed with local stakeholders, and behavior change campaigns grounded in social science concepts.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Legal Protections and Law Enforcement: Collaborating with government and regional authorities to\u00a0enhance legal protections for TFTs by building intelligence information exchanges and bolstering law enforcement capacity.\u00a0Demand Reduction: Facilitating behavior change outreach programs, informed by social science concepts, to curtail the demand for TFTs. \u00a0\u00a0Competitive projects will work to support the Service's key objectives and bolster long-term conservation capacity for TFTs. We broadly define capacity to include: 1) the capacity of habitat to sustain TFT populations through threat reduction and habitat restoration activities and 2) the capacity of individuals and institutions at local and national levels to champion the conservation of TFTs in those countries and regions.\u00a0We prioritize the following actions to bolster long-term TFT conservation capacity within the broader Service program goal:Cultivate enduring conservation capacity among local and indigenous communities, local and national non-governmental organizations, government bodies, and other pertinent stakeholders.Support the growth of local conservation initiatives that promotes opportunities to build skills and develop networks of local multidisciplinary practitioners relevant to TFT conservation.\u00a0Facilitate information sharing between communities, turtle networks,\u202fgovernment and regional authorities;\u202fand institutions on effective techniques to reduce the threats to TFTs in their habitats.\u202f\u00a0Identify and address gaps in TFT conservation through a comprehensive, interdisciplinary approach.Develop and implement community-led action plans with direct conservation impacts that promote sustained threat reduction and consistent monitoring (habitat or species) to identify and alert relevant entities for more urgent or expanded attention if increased threats are identified.\u00a0Provide clear evidence of how the proposed activities will yield lasting, significant benefits for the species in focus.\u00a0Proposals should demonstrate how project activities directly address one or more of the key objectives and actions and include a plan for monitoring and evaluation (i.e., measuring indicators). For this Notice of Funding Opportunity, while all projects that work to implement one or more of the overall Service program goals are eligible for funding, TFTs as listed in the table below or threat reduction activities focused in the geographic area of South Asia and Southeast Asia will be prioritized.\u202fTable 1: Taxonomic list by family of non-U.S. terrestrial tortoises and freshwater turtles with high extinction risk and most urgent conservation needs.FamilyTaxonCommon NameChelidaeChelodina mccordi mccordi and Chelodina mccordi timorensisRoti Island Snake-necked Turtle and Timor Snake-necked Turtle\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0GeoemydidaeBatagur affinis, Batagur baska, Batagur borneoensis, Batagur dhongoka, Batagur kachuga and Batagur trivittataSouthern River Terrapin, Northern River Terrapin, Painted Terrapin, Three-striped Roofed Turtle, Red-crowned Roof Turtle and Myanmar Roofed Turtle\u00a0Cuora amboinensis, Cuora bourreti, Cuora cyclornata, Cuora galbinifrons, Cuora mouhotii and Cuora picturataSoutheast Asian Box Turtle, Bourret's Box Turtle, Vietnamese Three-striped Box Turtle, Indochinese Box Turtle, Keeled Box Turtle and Southern Vietnam Box Turtle\u00a0Cyclemys atripons, Cyclemys oldhamii, Cyclemys pulchristriataWestern Black-bridged Leaf Turtle, Southeast Asian Leaf Turtle and Eastern Black-bridged Leaf Turtle\u00a0Geoclemys hamiltoniiSpotted Pond Turtle\u00a0Geoemyda spengleriBlack-breasted Leaf Turtle\u00a0Hardella thurjiiCrowned River Turtle\u00a0Heosemys annandalii, Heosemys depressa, Heosemys grandis and Heosemys spinosaYellow-headed Temple Turtle, Arakan Forest Turtle, Giant Asian Pond Turtle and Spiny Turtle\u00a0Leucocephalon yuwonoiSulawesi Forest Turtle\u00a0Mauremys annamensis and Mauremys muticaVietnamese Pond Turtle and Yellow Pond Turtle\u00a0Melanochelys tricarinataTricarinate Hill Turtle\u00a0Morenia ocellata and Morenia petersiBurmese Eyed Turtle and Indian Eyed Turtle\u00a0Orlitia borneensisMalaysian Giant Turtle\u00a0Pangshura sylhetensisAssam Roofed Turtle\u00a0Sacalia bealei and Sacalia quadriocellataBeale\u2019s Eyed Turtle and Four-eyed Turtle\u00a0Siebenrockiella crassicollis and Siebenrockiella leytensisBlack Marsh Turtle and Palawan Forest Turtle\u00a0Vijayachelys silvaticaCochin Forest Cane Turtle\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0PlatysternidaePlatysternon megacephalumBig-headed Turtle\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0TestudinidaeGeochelone platynotaBurmese Star Tortoise\u00a0Indotestudo elongata, Indotestudo forstenii and Indotestudo travancoricaElongated Tortoise, Sulawesi Tortoise and Travancore Tortoise\u00a0Manouria emys and Manouria impressaAsian Giant Tortoise and Impressed Tortoise\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0TrionychidaeChitra chitra, Chitra indica and Chitra vandijkiSoutheast Asian Narrow-headed Softshell Turtle, South Asian Narrow-headed Softshell Turtle and Myanmar Narrow-headed Softshell Turtle\u00a0Nilssonia formosa, Nilssonia gangetica, Nilssonia hurum, Nilssonia leithii and Nilssonia nigricansMyanmar Peacock Softshell Turtle, Indian Softshell Turtle, and Indian Peacock Softshell Turtle, Leith\u2019s Softshell Turtle and Black Softshell Turtle\u00a0Palea steindachneri, Pelochelys cantorii and Rafetus swinhoeiWattle-necked Softshell Turtle, Asian Giant Softshell Turtle and Yangtze Giant Softshell Turtle\u00a0",

        "synopsisDesc": "The purpose of this Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) is to invite Cooperative Agreement (U24) applications for the continued development and sustainment of high-value informatics research resources to improve the acquisition, analysis, visualization, and interpretation of data across the cancer research continuum including cancer biology, cancer treatment and diagnosis, early cancer detection, risk assessment and prevention, cancer control and epidemiology, and/or cancer health disparities. As a component of the NCI's Informatics Technology for Cancer Research (ITCR) Program, this FOA focuses on sustaining operations and improving the user experience and availability of existing, widely-adopted informatics tools and resources. This is in contrast to early-stage and advanced development efforts to generate these tools and resources that are supported by companion ITCR FOAs. To be successful, the proposed sustainment plan must provide clear justification for why the research resource should be maintained and how it has benefitted and will continue to benefit the cancer research field. In addition, mechanisms for assessing and maximizing the value of the resource to researchers and supporting collaboration and deep engagement between the resource and the targeted research community should be described.",
